    <h2>Game Rules:</h2>
    <p>Choose a player to go first. That player throws a die and scores as many points as the total shown on the die providing the die doesnâ€™t roll a 1. The player may continue rolling and accumulating points (but risk rolling a 1) or end his turn.

      If the player rolls a 1 his turn is over, he loses all points he accumulated that turn, and he passes the die to the next player.
      
      Play passes from player to player until a winner is determined.
